While the Euler can be made custom-order, Vanguard-class mechs specifically are built with firepower and mobility in mind for use within the forces of the EDF and its licensees, though its flexibility has lent it to roles such as scouts or turrets.",

Have them support defenders, but don't be afraid of letting them retreat to cover other artillery units. It features an on-turn-off-turn pattern where it supports or attacks each turn."
