Even more odd is the NHP's loyalty to its team even when unshackled, often following orders long after a pilot has passed out from whatever stressful thing was happening. Whether it's from pity, mercy, or simple dedication, AAF licensees who manage to pass all the required checks to receive a Yama-Class NHP of their own are almost always more than satisfied with the performance they get with it.</div>",
